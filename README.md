### Smart Room Project Description

This smart room project is designed to read temperature data using an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) connected to a temperature sensor (LM35), display the temperature on an LCD screen, and control various LEDs and devices (like a heater or fan) based on the temperature and user input through buttons

#### Components Used:
1. **ATmega32 Microcontroller**: The central unit that reads the temperature from the sensor, processes the input from buttons, and controls the outputs (LCD and LEDs).
2. **LM35 Temperature Sensor**: Provides an analog voltage proportional to the temperature.
3. **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)**: Used to display the current temperature.
4. **LEDs**: Represent different devices such as a heater, fan, and indicators for various statuses.
5. **Buttons**: User input buttons to toggle LEDs or control the devices.
6. **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)**: Reads the analog signal from the temperature sensor and converts it to a digital value that the microcontroller can process.
7. **Buzzer**: Optional, can be used for alerts or notifications.
8. **Fan and Heater**: These could be represented by motors or LEDs that indicate whether they are on or off.

#### Operation Overview:
1. **Temperature Reading**:
   - The microcontroller reads the analog output from the LM35 temperature sensor using its ADC.
   - The ADC value is then converted to a corresponding temperature in Celsius.

2. **Display on LCD**:
   - The current temperature is continuously updated and displayed on the LCD screen.

3. **Button Control**:
   - **Button 1 (PD2)**: Toggles an LED connected to PC0 on or off. This can represent turning on or off a device or just an indicator.
   - **Button 2 (PD3)**: Controls another LED connected to PC1. This LED turns on while the button is pressed.

4. **Temperature-Based Control**:
   - If the temperature is below a certain threshold (e.g., 30°C), the heater (represented by LED on PD1) is turned on.
   - If the temperature exceeds the threshold, the heater is turned off, and the fan (represented by LED on PD0) is turned on.
   - This logic can simulate a basic thermostat functionality, where devices are turned on or off based on the room temperature.

#### Code Explanation:

- **Initialization**: 
  - Initializes the LCD, ADC, LEDs, and buttons.
  - Sets up ports for input and output.

- **Main Loop**:
  - Continuously checks the button states to toggle LEDs.
  - Reads the temperature using the ADC, converts it to Celsius, and displays it on the LCD.
  - Controls the LEDs (representing heater and fan) based on the temperature.

#### Example Use Case:
- **Scenario**: The room temperature is 25°C.
  - The LCD shows "temperature=25°C".
  - Since 25°C is below the 30°C threshold, the heater LED (PD1) is on.
  - The fan LED (PD0) is off.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Pressing Button 1 toggles the LED on PC0, simulating turning on or off a device.
  - Holding Button 2 keeps the LED on PC1 on, simulating a temporary action.

This project serves as a foundational example of how microcontrollers can be used in home automation systems to control environments based on sensor data and user inputs.
